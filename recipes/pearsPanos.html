    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>A sweet delicious aternative dessert to eat with friends in a cloudy autumn. WARNING: contains alchol!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>4 Bosc pears</ul>
    <ul>1/2 cup white sugar</ul>
    <ul>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</ul>
    <ul>1/4 cup Cointreau or other orange liqueur</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol><b>Step 1</b></ol>
    <p>Peel the pears. You can halve and core them, or leave them whole: just carefully core the blossom end of each pear and remove the seeds.</p>
    <ol><b>Step 2</b></ol>
    <p>Place the pears into a large saucepan. Fill with enough water to cover the pears by 1 inch. Stir in the sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until the liquid has reduced into a light syrup; this may take up to 1 hour. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Cool until just warm, then stir in the liqueur and serve.</p>
